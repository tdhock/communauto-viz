\title{Analysis of Communauto rates}
\author{Toby Dylan Hocking}

\maketitle

This goal of this report is to show how much money could be saved in
communauto by choosing the ``Tarif Longue Distance'' rather than the
default ``Forfait C.''

The figure above shows that I was billed 233.90\$ for a Forfait C trip
of 583km and 1 day, 13 hours. If I chose the ``Tarif Longue Distance''
I would have been billed only 150.69\$, for a savings of 83.21\$.

It also shows that for 2 day trips like this, it is cheaper to use
``Forfait C'' only if you drive less than 38km. That is not plausible,
so a money-saving rule is to always choose ``Tarif Longue Distance''
for 2 day trips.

The figure above shows that I was billed 167.30\$ for a Forfait C trip
of 334km and 2 days, 3 hours. If I chose the ``Tarif Longue Distance''
I would have been billed only 148.27\$, for a savings of 19.03\$.

It also shows that for trips like this (a few hours more than 2 days),
it is cheaper to use ``Forfait C'' for trips under 200km.
